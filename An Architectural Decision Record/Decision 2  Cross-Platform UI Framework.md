# Decision 2: UI Framework
## Justification:
The decision to adopt a cross-platform framework (e.g., React Native) stands as a cost-effective and efficient approach, as it allows for code reusability across both iOS and Android. This streamlines the development process and simplifies ongoing maintenance.
## Status:
Approved
## Consequences:
### Positive:
Code reusability and faster development.
### Negative:
Potential limitations in accessing advanced native features may require custom development workarounds.
